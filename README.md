<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Marvel searcher for comics, series, authors and characters. Each result contains a short description of them, when is available, as well as the related content to the specific search. Also for performing the suggestions I have used a tries data structure. However, it is only implemented for the comics because this part should be implemented in the server because right now the client has to download the entire list of comics and make the using this list.
